# Easy SQLite Module
<h2> Basic Idea </h2>
<p>This repo is about the <strong>SQLite</strong> module in python. Python has a great module about the <strong>SQLite</strong> database(sqlite3).</br>
But if you want to use that module,you have to learn SQLite queries. At least basicly.</br>
This repo helps you about queries. That module has removed the queries and put some functions instead.</br></p>

<h3> Notes </h3>
<li>
  <ul> Documentation coming soon</ul>
  <ul> Module's GUI for simple usage </ul>
  <ul> New functions ... </ul>
